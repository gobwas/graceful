> Go tools for graceful restarts.

# Overview

Package graceful provides tools for sharing file descriptors between the
processes.

The most common intent to use it is to get graceful restarts of an application.

# Usage

Graceful proposes a client-server mechanism of sharing file descriptors. 
That is, application that owns a descriptors is a **server** in `graceful`
terminology, and an application that wants to receive those descriptors is a
**client**.

The most common use of `graceful` looks like this:

```go
// Somewhere close to the application init.
err := graceful.Receive("/var/run/app.sock", func(fd int, meta graceful.Meta) {
	// Handle received descriptor depending on application logic.
	// For net.Listener and net.Conn there are helper functions
	// graceful.FdListener() and graceful.FdConn().
})

// Somewhere in the application.
// This code will send `ln`, `conn` and `file` descriptors to every accepted
// connection on unix domain socket "/var/run/app.sock".
go graceful.ListenAndServe("/var/run/app.sock", graceful.SequenceHandler(
	graceful.ListenerHandler(ln),
	graceful.ConnHandler(conn),
	graceful.FileHandler(file),
))
```

That is, `graceful` does not force users to stick to some logic of processing
restarts. It just provides mechanism for sharing descriptors in a client-server
way.

If you have a more difficult logic of restarts, you could use less general API
of `graceful`:

```go

// Listen for an upcoming instance at the socket.
ln, err := net.Listen("unix", "/var/run/app.sock")
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}

app, err := ln.Accept()
if err != nil {
	// handle error
}

// Send some application specific data first.
if _, err := app.Write(data); err != nil {
	// handle error
}

// Then send some descriptors to the connection.
err := graceful.SendListenerTo(app, ln, nil)


```


There is an [example web application](example) that handles restarts
gracefully. Note that it does not handle `SIGTERM` signal just to show up that
`graceful` if flexible and could be used in a simple way. 


# Status

This library is not tagged as stable version (and not tagged at all yet). 
This means that backward compatibility can be broken due some changes or
refactoring.
